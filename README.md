## Collaboration Tools

The following tools are proposed to support effective remote mob programming. These tools were selected for their ease of use, availability, and ability to closely simulate face-to-face collaboration. The team may revise or refine this toolset as needed.

### Communication & Coordination
- **Microsoft Teams**
  - Used for voice and video communication during mob programming sessions
  - Enables real-time discussion similar to face-to-face collaboration
  - Chat functionality allows sharing links, notes, and decisions during sessions

### Recording
- **Microsoft Teams Recording**
  - Used to record mob programming sessions as evidence of team collaboration
  - Recordings will be uploaded as unlisted videos to a hosting platform such as YouTube or Vimeo
  - Video links will be documented in this repository as required by the assignment

### Development Environment
- **IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition)**
  - Primary IDE for Java development
  - Provides built-in support for JUnit testing, refactoring, and code coverage analysis

### Collaborative Coding
- **IntelliJ Code With Me**
  - Enables real-time shared coding sessions within the IDE
  - Supports mob programming by allowing multiple team members to view and edit code simultaneously

### Version Control
- **GitHub**
  - Central repository for all source code, documentation, screenshots, and artifacts
  - All team members collaborate on a single shared codebase

### Testing & Code Coverage
- **JUnit 5 (Jupiter)**
  - Used for unit testing the Gilded Rose codebase
- **IntelliJ Built-in Code Coverage**
  - Used to measure and display production code coverage
  - Screenshots of coverage results will be committed to this repository

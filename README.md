## Collaboration Tools

Our team uses Microsoft Teams as our primary collaboration platform.

### Communication & Coordination
- **Microsoft Teams**
  - Used for voice and video communication during mob programming sessions
  - Provides real-time discussion similar to face-to-face collaboration
  - Chat functionality allows us to share links, notes, and decisions during sessions

### Recording
- **Microsoft Teams Recording**
  - Used to record mob programming sessions as evidence of team collaboration
  - Recordings will be uploaded to a video hosting platform (e.g., YouTube or Vimeo) and linked in this repository as required

Additional tools (such as IDE-based collaborative coding tools) will be selected and documented as the project progresses.

Note: This repository will be updated incrementally as we complete each assignment step.
